    "\n",
    "React.js is one of the most talked about JavaScript web frameworks in years. Alongside Angular, and more recently Vue, React is a critical tool that has had a big impact on the way we build web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "A JavaScript library for building user interfaces : \n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a library. For building user interfaces. This is perfect because, more often than not, this is all we want. The best part about this description is that it highlights React’s simplicity. It’s not a mega framework. It’s not a full-stack solution that’s going to handle everything from the database to real-time updates over web socket connections. We don’t actually want most of these pre-packaged solutions, because in the end, they usually cause more problems than they solve. Facebook sure did listen to what we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "**React.js is just the view. That’s it :**\n",
    "\n",
    "React.js is generally thought of as the view layer in an application. You might have used library like Handlebars, or jQuery in the past. Just as jQuery manipulates UI elements, or Handlebars templates are inserted onto the page, React components change what the user sees. This is literally all there is to React. We want to render this data to the UI, so we pass it to a React component which handles the job of getting the HTML into the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering what the big deal is. On the surface, React appears to be another rendering technology. But it’s much more than that. It can make application development incredibly simple. That’s why it’s become so popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "**React.js is simple :**\n",
    "\n",
    "React doesn’t have many moving parts for us to learn about and understand. The advantage to having a small API to work with is that you can spend more time familiarizing yourself with it, experimenting with it, and so on. The opposite is true of large frameworks, where all your time is devoted to figuring out how everything works.\n",
    "\n",
    "React is divided into two major APIs. First, there’s the React DOM. This is the API that’s used to perform the actual rendering on a web page. Second, there’s the React component API. These are the parts of the page that are actually rendered by React DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a React component, we have the following areas to think about:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data: This is data that comes from somewhere (the component doesn’t care where), and is rendered by the component.\n",
    "* Lifecycle: These are methods that we implement that respond to changes in the lifecycle of the component. For example, the component is about to be rendered.\n",
    "* Events: This is code that we write for responding to user interactions.\n",
    "* JSX: This is the syntax of React components used to describe UI structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**React has a declarative UI structure :**\n",
    "\n",
    "React newcomers have a hard time coming to grips with the idea that components mix markup in with their JavaScript. If you’ve looked at React examples and had the same adverse reaction, don’t worry. Initially, we’re all skeptical of this approach, and I think the reason is that we’ve been conditioned for decades by the separation of concerns principle. Now, whenever we see things mixed together, we automatically assume that this is bad and shouldn’t happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax used by React components is called **JSX (JavaScript XML)**. The idea is actually quite simple. A component renders content by returning some JSX. The JSX itself is usually HTML markup, mixed with custom tags for the React components. What’s absolutely groundbreaking here is that we don’t have to perform little micro-operations to change the content of a component.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, think about using something like jQuery to build your application. You have a page with some content on it, and you want to add a class to a paragraph when a button is clicked. Performing these steps is easy enough, but the challenge is that there are steps to perform at all. This is called imperative programming, and it’s problematic for UI development. While this example of changing the class of an element in response to an event is simple, real applications tend to involve more than 3 or 4 steps to make something happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "React components don’t require executing steps in an imperative way to render content. This is why JSX is so central to React components. The XML-style syntax makes it easy to describe what the UI should look like. That is, what are the HTML elements that this component is going to render? This is called declarative programming, and is very well-suited for UI development.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time and data :**\n",
    "\n",
    "Another area that’s difficult for React newcomers to grasp is the idea that JSX is like a static string, representing a chunk of rendered output. Are we just supposed to keep rendering this same view? This is where time and data come into play. React components rely on data being passed into them. This data represents the dynamic aspects of the UI. For example, a UI element that’s rendered based on a Boolean value could change the next time the component is rendered. Here’s an illustration of the idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time the React component is rendered, it’s like taking a snapshot of the JSX at that exact moment in time. As our application moves forward through time, we have an ordered collection of rendered user interface components. In addition to declaratively describing what a UI should be, re-rendering the same JSX content makes things much easier for developers. The challenge is making sure that React can handle the performance demands of this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance matters with React :**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using React to build user interfaces means that we can declare the structure of the UI with JSX. This is less error-prone than the imperative approach to assembling the UI piece by piece. However, the declarative approach does present us with one challenge—performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, having a declarative UI structure is fine for the initial rendering, because there’s nothing on the page yet. So the React renderer can look at the structure declared in JSX, and render it into the browser DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the initial render, React components and their JSX are no different from other template libraries. For instance, Handlebars will render a template to HTML markup as a string, which is then inserted into the browser DOM. Where React is different from libraries like Handlebars is when data changes, and we need to re-render the component. Handlebars will just rebuild the entire HTML string, the same way it did on the initial render. Since this is problematic for performance, we often end up implementing imperative workarounds that manually update tiny bits of the DOM. What we end up with is a tangled mess of declarative templates, and imperative code to handle the dynamic aspects of the UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don’t do this in React. This is what sets React apart from other view libraries. Components are declarative for the initial render, and they stay this way even as they’re re-rendered. It’s what React does under the hood that makes re-rendering declarative UI structures possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "React has something called the *virtual DOM*, which is used to keep a representation of the real DOM elements in memory. It does this so that each time we re-render a component, it can compare the new content, to the content that’s already displayed on the page. Based on the difference, the virtual DOM can execute the imperative steps necessary to make the changes. So not only do we get to keep our declarative code when we need to update the UI, React will also make sure that it’s done in a performant way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**React.js has the right level of abstraction :**\n",
    "\n",
    "React.js doesn’t have a great deal of abstraction, but the abstractions the framework does implement are crucial to its success.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the preceding section, you saw how JSX syntax translates to the low-level operations that we have no interest in maintaining. The more important way to look at how React translates our declarative UI components is the fact that we don’t necessarily care what the render target is. The render target happens to be the browser DOM with React. But this is changing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re only just starting to see this with React Native, but the possibilities are endless. I personally will not be surprised when React Toast becomes a thing, targeting toasters that can singe the rendered output of JSX on to bread. The abstraction level with React is at the right level, and it’s in the right place.\n",
    "\n",
    "From left to right, we have React Web (just plain React), React Native, React Desktop, and React Toast. As you can see, to target something new, the same pattern applies:\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement components specific to the target\n",
    "Implement a React renderer that can perform the platform-specific operations under the hood\n",
    "Profit\n",
    "This is obviously an oversimplification of what’s actually implemented for any given React environment. But the details aren’t so important to us. What’s important is that we can use our React knowledge to focus on describing the structure of our user interface on any platform."

    "**The purpose for using React.js is as follows:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* React allow you to change data without reloading the page of large web applications so developers work is made easy. It is being designed for the purpose of the benefits like: to be simple at the base, scalable to highest level possible and fast as much as possible and also works on user interfaces in the application.\n",
    "* Some other reasons why React become so popular is like: working with the DOM API is hard, where as, React gives developers ability to get friendlier while working on Virtual Browser than real browser.\n",
    "* Even if you wish to build complex apps people want to use you need to make use of react (or another major framework - vue, preact, angular), also helps in managing those changing states and dynamically present different views to the user based on state information.\n",
    "* As the application grows in scale and scope you might need to get more complex structures and other things in check, React’s declarative nature of components makes it very easy to handle these changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**React usage benefits :**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Speed :**\n",
    "The React basically allows developers to utilize individual parts of their application on both client-side and the server-side, which ultimately boosts the speed of the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, different developers can write individual parts and all changes made won’t cause the logic of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flexibility :**\n",
    "Compared to other frontend frameworks, the React code is easier to maintain and is flexible due to its modular structure. This flexibility, in turn, saves huge amount of time and cost to businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance :**\n",
    "React JS was designed to provide high performance in mind. The core of the framework offers a virtual DOM program and server-side rendering, which makes complex apps run extremely fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usability :**\n",
    "Deploying React is fairly easy to accomplish if you have some basic knowledge of JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, an expert JavaScript developer can easily learn all ins and outs of the React framework in a matter of a day or two.\n",
    "\n",
    "**It’s Easier to Learn for developers :** \n",
    "One of the main concerns developers have is choosing a framework (or library) that is easier to learn and implement.  React is easy to grasp for developers who are familiar with Javascript. So if you have a team of developers that are very well-versed with Javascript, Reactjs should be your best bet. However, even if developers don’t know Javascript, React can be the right place to start. Unlike Angular, React holds a smooth learning curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "**React enables developers to reuse components:** \n",
    "In React, your application comprises of components. Ideally, you start with building small components like buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, menus, etc. and create wrapper components around these smaller components. And as you go on writing the higher level wrapper components, you will have a single root component and several hierarchical components. Now, here’s a no brainer: each component in React has its own logic. So if you want to re-use the button component through your app, you are good to go. \n",
    "\n",
    "**It provides a unique Abstraction Layer:**\n",
    "Another lesser-known business-related benefit with React is that it allows for a good abstraction layer, which means an end-user can’t access the complex internals. Your developer only needs to be aware of some basics, and they’d better off knowing the internal functionalities. Moreover, it does not dictate any architectural patterns like MVC, MVP, and MVVM. Your developer is free to design an app’s architecture in any way he sees fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**It’s well established with a vibrant ecosystem of Developer tools:**\n",
    "React consists of rich and vibrant ecosystem. Developers can find dozens of ready-made and customizable charts, graphics, documentation tools, and other components that allow them to build a web app in lesser time without reinventing the wheel."

    "### 4. What are MongoDB's most important features?"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Let’s take a look at MongoDB’s top five technical features:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ad-hoc queries for optimized, real-time analytics :**\n",
    "\n",
    "    When designing the schema of a database, it is impossible to know in advance all the queries that will be performed by end users. An ad hoc query is a short-lived command whose value depends on a variable. Each time an ad hoc query is executed, the result may be different, depending on the variables in question.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Optimizing the way in which ad-hoc queries are handled can make a significant difference at scale, when thousands to millions of variables may need to be considered. This is why MongoDB, a document-oriented, flexible schema database, stands apart as the cloud database platform of choice for enterprise applications that require real-time analytics. With ad-hoc query support that allows developers to update ad-hoc queries in real time, the improvement in performance can be game-changing.\n",
    "\n",
    "    MongoDB supports field queries, range queries, and regular expression searches. Queries can return specific fields and also account for user-defined functions. This is made possible because MongoDB indexes BSON documents and uses the MongoDB Query Language (MQL).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Indexing appropriately for better query executions :**\n",
    "\n",
    "    In our experience, the number one issue that many technical support teams fail to address with their users is indexing. Done right, indexes are intended to improve search speed and performance. A failure to properly define appropriate indices can and usually will lead to a myriad of accessibility issues, such as problems with query execution and load balancing.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Without the right indices, a database is forced to scan documents one by one to identify the ones that match the query statement. But if an appropriate index exists for each query, user requests can be optimally executed by the server. MongoDB offers a broad range of indices and features with language-specific sort orders that support complex access patterns to datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Notably, MongoDB indices can be created on demand to accommodate real-time, ever-changing query patterns and application requirements. They can also be declared on any field within any of your documents, including those nested within arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Replication for better data availability and stability :**\n",
    "\n",
    "    When your data only resides in a single database, it is exposed to multiple potential points of failure, such as a server crash, service interruptions, or even good old hardware failure. Any of these events would make accessing your data nearly impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Replication allows you to sidestep these vulnerabilities by deploying multiple servers for disaster recovery and backup. Horizontal scaling across multiple servers that house the same data (or shards of that same data) means greatly increased data availability and stability. Naturally, replication also helps with load balancing. When multiple users access the same data, the load can be distributed evenly across servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In MongoDB, replica sets are employed for this purpose. A primary server or node accepts all write operations and applies those same operations across secondary servers, replicating the data. If the primary server should ever experience a critical failure, any one of the secondary servers can be elected to become the new primary node. And if the former primary node comes back online, it does so as a secondary server for the new primary node.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sharding :**\n",
    "\n",
    "    When dealing with particularly large datasets, sharding—the process of splitting larger datasets across multiple distributed collections, or “shards”—helps the database distribute and better execute what might otherwise be problematic and cumbersome queries. Without sharding, scaling a growing web application with millions of daily users is nearly impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Like replication via replication sets, sharding in MongoDB allows for much greater horizontal scalability. Horizontal scaling means that each shard in every cluster houses a portion of the dataset in question, essentially functioning as a separate database. The collection of distributed server shards forms a single, comprehensive database much better suited to handling the needs of a popular, growing application with zero downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "    All operations in a sharding environment are handled through a lightweight process called mongos. Mongos can direct queries to the correct shard based on the shard key. Naturally, proper sharding also contributes significantly to better load balancing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Load balancing :**\n",
    "\n",
    "    At the end of the day, optimal load balancing remains one of the holy grails of large-scale database management for growing enterprise applications. Properly distributing millions of client requests to hundreds or thousands of servers can lead to a noticeable (and much appreciated) difference in performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Fortunately, via horizontal scaling features like replication and sharding, MongoDB supports large-scale load balancing. The platform can handle multiple concurrent read and write requests for the same data with best-in-class concurrency control and locking protocols that ensure data consistency. There’s no need to add an external load balancer—MongoDB ensures that each and every user has a consistent view and quality experience with the data they need to access"
