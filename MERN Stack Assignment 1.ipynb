    "**Prop Drilling :** When building a React application, there is often the need for a deeply nested component to use data provided by another component that is much higher in the hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following example components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* < EditUsersPage />, which includes selectedUserAddress in its component state and renders a < User /> component\n",
    "* < User />, which renders a < UserDetails /> component\n",
    "* < UserDetails />, which renders a < UserAddress /> component\n",
    "* A < UserAddress /> component that requires the selectedUserAddress property stored in the < EditUsersPage /> state\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest approach is to simply pass a **selectedUserAddress** prop from each component to the next in the hierarchy from the source component to the deeply nested component. This is called prop drilling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary disadvantage of prop drilling is that components that should not otherwise be aware of the data. In this case < User /> and < UserDetails /> become unnecessarily complicated and are harder to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to avoid it :**\n",
    "To avoid prop drilling, a common approach is to use React context. This allows a **Provider** component that supplies data to be defined, and allows nested components to consume context data via either a **Consumer** component or a **useContext** hook.\n",
    "\n",
    "While context can be used directly for sharing global state, it is also possible to use context indirectly via a state management module, such as Redux."
