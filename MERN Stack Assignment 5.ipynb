Earlier the developers have gained particular expertise in any of the above fields and carry forward their career in that domain. However, the trends are changed now. The demand for technologies has mandated the developers to work on both Frontend as well as on Backend and much more.\n",

    "Consider a very large database whose sharding has not been done. For example, let’s take a DataBase of a college in which all the student’s record (present and past) in the whole college are maintained in a single database. So, it would contain very very large number of data, say 100, 000 records.\n",

    "Now when we need to find a student from this Database, each time around 100, 000 transactions has to be done to find the student, which is very very costly.\n",
